# ☕ Coffee App

A small **Java Swing GUI application** that simulates a coffee shop where you can order coffees with **3 different flavors**.

The user can enter their name, choose a coffee flavor, select the quantity, see the unit price, calculate the total and confirm the order using a simple window interface.

> Project created for learning purposes to practice **Java**, **Swing**, and basic GUI event handling.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🪟 **Graphical interface (Swing)** – no console menu.
- 👤 Text field to enter the **customer name**.
- ☕ ComboBox to choose the **coffee flavor**.
- 🔢 **Quantity selector** using a `JSpinner`.
- 💵 Display of **unit price** for the selected coffee.
- 🧮 Button **“Calcular precio”** to compute the total.
- ✅ Button **“Confirmar pedido”** to confirm the order.
- 📝 A large area to show the **order summary / messages**.

All labels and buttons are in **Spanish** (e.g. “¿Cómo te llamas?”, “Sabor de café”, “Cantidad”, “Precio unitario”).

## 🧱 Project Structure

Current repository structure:

    Coffee-App/
    ├── out/                # Compiled classes (generated by the IDE)
    ├── src/                # Source code
    │   ├── Main.java       # Entry point, sets Look & Feel and opens the window
    │   └── CoffeeApp.java  # JFrame with all Swing components and logic
    ├── Coffe app.iml       # IntelliJ IDEA project file
    └── README.md

- `Main.java` calls `SwingUtilities.invokeLater(...)` and creates a new `CoffeeApp()` window.
- `CoffeeApp.java` defines the `JFrame` form with labels, text fields, combo box, spinner, buttons, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java (JDK 8+ recommended; works with JDK 17/21).
- **GUI Toolkit:** Swing (`JFrame`, `JLabel`, `JTextField`, `JComboBox`, `JSpinner`, `JButton`, etc.).
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (project files included), but any Java IDE will work.
- **Version control:** Git & GitHub.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/calvopelado2989/Coffee-App.git
    cd Coffee-App

### 2️⃣ Run with IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)

1. Open **IntelliJ IDEA**.
2. Choose **Open** and select the `Coffee-App` folder.
3. Make sure the project SDK is set to a valid JDK.
4. In the **Project** view, open `src/Main.java`.
5. Click the green **Run** button next to the `main` method or at the top of the IDE.

A window titled **“Coffee Shop”** should appear.

---

### 3️⃣ Run from the terminal (optional)

If you prefer to run it manually:

    cd Coffee-App
    javac -d out src/*.java
    java -cp out Main

> On Windows PowerShell or CMD, make sure the `java` and `javac` commands are in your PATH (JDK properly installed).

## 🔍 How the App Works

1. The user enters their **name** in the text field.
2. Selects a **coffee flavor** from the drop-down list.
3. Chooses the **quantity** with the spinner.
4. The **unit price** is shown next to “Precio unitario”.
5. Clicking **“Calcular precio”** calculates the total price (unit price × quantity) and shows it in the bottom area.
6. Clicking **“Confirmar pedido”** confirms the order and can show a thank-you message or summary.

This project is a good example to learn:

- How to build a basic window with Swing.
- How to connect buttons and inputs using **ActionListeners**.
- How to update labels / text areas from user input.

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand how a **Swing `JFrame`** is created and displayed.
- Use starter Swing components:
  - `JLabel`, `JTextField`, `JComboBox`, `JSpinner`, `JButton`.
- Handle button events to react to user actions.
- Organize a small Java GUI project with a clear `Main` entry point.

---

## 🧩 Future Improvements

Some ideas to extend the project:

- Add more coffee flavors and custom prices.
- Show both **unit price** and **total** clearly in the summary.
- Validate input (e.g., require a non-empty name).
- Save orders in a list or table and display **order history**.
- Support English and Spanish with a language selector.
- Extract a `Coffee` / `Order` class to model the data better.
- Add unit tests to verify price calculations.
